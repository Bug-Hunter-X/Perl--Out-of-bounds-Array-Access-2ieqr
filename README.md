This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an array element beyond its defined index. The 'bug.pl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.pl' offers a corrected version.  The error results in undefined behavior, potentially leading to unexpected program crashes or incorrect results.  Always validate array indices before accessing elements to prevent this issue.
